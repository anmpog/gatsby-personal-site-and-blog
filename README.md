# Personal Site Readme
This site was built using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Specifically, I used a Gatsby starter called the [gatsby-starter-blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/), which allows you to write blog posts in Markdown. The documentation for Gatsby is really great, and I encourage anyone who is curious to take a look. 

## CSS
I tried to keep styles close to the components using them. There are global stylesheets for styles that are more global in nature (for commonly used elements) and media queries. When it comes to styling, the first place to look for styling is going to be in file for the component in question. The project also includes the use of TypographyJS, but it is used minimally and really only to take advantage of one of its dependencies. In the future I'd like to build a plugin that encapsulates the functionality I wanted out of TypographyJS. Font styling is defined in the global.css file. This site also used SVGs generated by [SVG Backgrounds](https://www.svgbackgrounds.com). A plugin was used to allow pre-fetching of the Google Fonts I used in this project.
