## Fourth Post

Here's some shit in the post

```js{numberLines: true}
function test(param) {
  return (`Here's some thing with ${param`)
}

function foo(bar) {
  var a = 42,
      b = 'Prism';

  return a + bar(b);
}
```

I also want to test out the inline code highlighting because it's helpful to be able to write snippets like `function testInlineHighlight(param)`
